Notes:

I need to find out how to use the APIs for SIMIT first. 
    - Write simple program calling an API.

Siemens installs the Siemens.Simit.API.Coupling.dll into the GAC so it can be used by any custom .NET 
or C++/CLI simulation coupling without needing a local copy.

You need to reference this DLL from the GAC when building your integration layer.

Probaly will need to purchase SIMIT software from Simmens.
cannot download for free yet. I need to wait for account to be verified. See SS-01
